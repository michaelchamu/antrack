<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Promotion</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an activity that requires the active marketing or promotion of the hydrocarbon
    potential of the Namibian acreage to local and international oil exploration and production companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having identified prospects and leads with potential for accumulating hydrocarbons and
    having carried out all necessary petroleum geological and geophysical work required, such acreage is offered to
    local and international oil companies. In furtherance of the above, the company attends important international oil
    and gas promotion conferences targeting the oil capitals/centres of the world in order to cover as wide a spectrum
    of clients as possible.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Advisory and Regulatory role</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The institutional role of NAMCOR is to actively promote the hydrocarbon potential of
    Namibia. In exercising this role the company is tasked with advising the <a href="http://www.mme.gov.na"
                                                                                target="_blank">Ministry of Mines and
        Energy </a> on policy issues regarding the upstream petroleum industry and monitoring the petroleum activities
    of oil companies operating within Namibia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NAMCOR has since independence facilitated the signing of several petroleum agreements
    with international oil companies. These agreements have been the result of four bidding rounds and an open licensing
    system which was adopted as an alternative to the bidding rounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To date, 53 exploration licences, 1 production licence, and 2 Coal Bed Methane licences
    have been issued to Namibian and international oil companies. Overall, a total of 18 wells have been drilled,
    offshore Namibia, of which 8 wells have been drilled in the Kudu licence. As a result of these and numerous other
    onshore exploration activities, an extensive geological and geophysical database on petroleum activities within
    Namibia is in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The database consists of data from 15 wells drilled within Namibia, both onshore and
    offshore. In total more than 120 000 line kilometres of 2D seismic data and more than 25 000 kmÂ² of 3D seismic data
    have been acquired.</p>
