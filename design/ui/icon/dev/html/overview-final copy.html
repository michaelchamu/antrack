                        of 15 exploratory wells and 7 appraisal wells in the KUDU Gas Field/license area have been
                        drilled offshore Namibia. Subsequently, 10 ODP/DSDP wells have been drilled for research studies
                        by various universities offshore. In addition, 10 exploratory wells have been drilled onshore 2D
